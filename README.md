# Zsh Autocompletion for Python Virtual Environments

This guide will help you set up a custom Zsh function to activate Python virtual environments and enable autocompletion for environment names.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Define the `activate` Function

Add the following function definition to your `~/.zshrc` file. This function activates a Python virtual environment located in `~/envs/`.

```bash
# Function to activate Python virtual environments
activate() {
    if [ -z "$1" ]; then
        echo "Usage: activate env_name"
        return 1
    fi

    local env_path="$HOME/envs/$1"
    if [ -d "$env_path" ]; then
        source "$env_path/bin/activate"
    else
        echo "Environment '$1' does not exist."
        return 1
    fi
}
```
### 2. Create the Zsh Completion Script
Create a directory for custom Zsh completion scripts if it doesn't already exist:

```bash script
mkdir -p ~/.zsh/completion
```

### 3. Then create the completion script for the activate function

```bash

# copy and paste this
cat << 'EOF' > ~/.zsh/completion/_activate
#compdef activate

_activate() {
    local envs
    envs=(${(f)"$(ls -1 $HOME/envs)"})

    _describe 'envs' envs
}

compdef _activate activate
EOF
```

### 4. Source the Completion Script

Add the following lines to your `~/.zshrc` to ensure the completion script is sourced and the Zsh completion system is initialized:

```bash
# Add custom completion scripts directory to fpath
fpath=(~/.zsh/completion $fpath)

# Load and initialize Zsh completion system
autoload -Uz compinit
compinit
```


### 5. Reload Your Zsh Configuration

Reload your `~/.zshrc` to apply the changes:

```
source ~/.zshrc
```
